# TF-Records
Ever wanted a list of aliases but that pesky thing called "clear all" been in your way? Well, this doesn't solve it.

# Why, what?
It's obviously a list? Still roughly missing about 50% of the other entries plus cross referenced raw data this was pulled from (ergo INCOMPLETE for now). EYES ONLY.
"But this only shows ONE alias?"
Yes, all current records only have one, thankfully. Until there's actual aliasing, no, all records are accurate.
